### Secret Things

Hello Commet recruters

My name is Aaron. I created this project to try to demonstrate my ability to learn new things, and even though my exposure to Go has been limited, I wanted to create something that shows the skills I learned using JS can be easily transferred over.

Secret Things is a CLI tool that helps manage and store ENV vars, storing them in AWS Secrets Manager and taking advantage of concurrency in Go. Plus, it will be helpful in future projects.

## How it works

Using the AWS SDK, we'll store ENV vars in Secrets Manager. Each secret added will be stored with a tag indicating the project and stage environment.

Please note, for learning purposes, I turned off any AI in my IDE and will only resort to good old Google and Stack Overflow. Though in a working environment this might change, I wanted to demonstrate my ability to do research and not rely on AI. The reason for this is that, when working on a project, AI might not always help with adapting solutions to the specific project.
